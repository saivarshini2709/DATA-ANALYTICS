# # Comprehensive Data Analysis of Car Prices: Trends, Influences, and Market Insights 

# In[16]:


import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


# # Step 1: Data Reading

# In[17]:


df = pd.read_csv("car_price_dataset.csv")
df.info() 


# Observation: The dataset contains 10,000 rows and 10 columns with no missing values. Data types are appropriate, with categorical and numerical variables well-defined.
# The dataset contains 10,000 rows and 10 columns related to car pricing, including brand, model, year, engine size, fuel type, transmission type, mileage, number of doors, owner count, and price.
# 
# Brand (Categorical): The manufacturer of the car. 10 unique brands are present.
# 
# Model (Categorical): The model name of the car. 30 unique models are present.
# 
# Year (Numerical - Integer): The manufacturing year of the car (2000â€“2023).
# 
# Engine_Size (Numerical - Float): The size of the engine in liters (1.0â€“5.0).
# 
# Fuel_Type (Categorical): The type of fuel used (Diesel, Petrol, Hybrid, Electric).
# 
# Transmission (Categorical): The type of transmission (Manual, Automatic, Semi-Automatic).
# 
# Mileage (Numerical - Integer): The total kilometers driven (ranges from 25 to 299,947).
# 
# Doors (Numerical - Integer): The number of doors (2 to 5).
# 
# Owner_Count (Numerical - Integer): Number of previous owners (1 to 5).
# 
# Price (Numerical - Integer): The selling price of the car (ranging from 2,000 to 18,301).

# # Step 2: Checking for Missing Values and Duplicates

# In[18]:


print(df.isnull().sum())  
print("Duplicate Rows: {df.duplicated().sum()}") 


# Observation: No missing values or duplicate rows are present, ensuring data completeness.
# 
# 

# # Step 3: Handling Outliers in Price

# In[19]:


Q1, Q3 = df["Price"].quantile([0.25, 0.75]) 
IQR = Q3 - Q1  
df = df[(df["Price"] >= (Q1 - 1.5 * IQR)) & (df["Price"] <= (Q3 + 1.5 * IQR))]
df


# Observation: 6 extreme price values have been removed to enhance analysis accuracy.

# # Step 4: Converting Categorical Data Types

# In[20]:


for col in ["Brand", "Model", "Fuel_Type", "Transmission"]:
    df[col] = df[col].astype("category") 


# Observation: Proper type conversion optimizes memory usage and facilitates analysis of categorical variables.

# # Central Tendency (Mean, Median, Mode of Car Prices)

# In[27]:


mean_price = df["Price"].mean()
median_price = df["Price"].median()
mode_price = df["Price"].mode()[0]

print(f"Mean Price: {mean_price}")
print(f"Median Price: {median_price}")
print(f"Mode Price: {mode_price}")


#  Observation: Measures the average, middle, and most common price in the dataset.

# # Dispersion Metrics (Standard Deviation, Variance, Range)

# In[29]:


std_dev_price = df["Price"].std()
variance_price = df["Price"].var()
range_price = df["Price"].max() - df["Price"].min()

print(f"Standard Deviation: {std_dev_price}")
print(f"Variance: {variance_price}")
print(f"Price Range: {range_price}")


# Observation: Shows how widely car prices vary, indicating market diversity.

# # Step 5: Distribution of Car Prices

# In[21]:


sns.histplot(df["Price"], bins=30, kde=True, color="blue").set(title="Car Price Distribution")
plt.show()


#  Observation: The price distribution is right-skewed, indicating that most cars are in the lower price range.

# # Step 6: Car Price vs Year of Manufacture

# In[22]:


sns.scatterplot(x=df["Year"], y=df["Price"], alpha=0.5, color="green").set(title="Car Price vs Year")
plt.show()


# Observation: Newer cars have higher prices, confirming that car value depreciates with age.
# 
# 
# 

# # Step 7: Fuel Type Distribution

# In[23]:


sns.countplot(x=df["Fuel_Type"], palette="muted").set(title="Fuel Type Distribution")
plt.show()


# Observation: Petrol and Diesel cars dominate, while electric vehicles are still less common.

# # Step 8: Mileage vs Price Relationship

# In[24]:


sns.scatterplot(x=df["Mileage"], y=df["Price"], alpha=0.5, color="red").set(title="Mileage vs Price")
plt.show()


# Observation: Cars with higher mileage tend to have lower prices, showing depreciation due to usage.

# # Step 9: Boxplot for Price Outliers

# In[25]:


sns.boxplot(y=df["Price"], color="purple").set(title="Boxplot of Car Prices")
plt.show()


# Observation: Some extreme values exist, but outliers have already been filtered, making the data cleaner.
# 
# 

# # Step 10: Correlation Analysis

# In[26]:


sns.heatmap(df.corr(), annot=True, cmap="coolwarm").set(title="Feature Correlation Heatmap")
plt.show()


# # Conclusion

# Observation: Mileage, Year, and Engine Size are key factors influencing Price, providing insights for predictive modeling.

# Conclusion of Car Price Data Analysis ðŸš—ðŸ“Š
# 1.Car Prices Follow a Right-Skewed Distribution:
# 
# Most cars are priced in the lower range, while a few high-end models have significantly higher prices.
# 
# 2,Newer Cars Have Higher Prices:
# 
# Car value depreciates over time, with older models having lower prices compared to newer ones.
# 
# 3.Fuel Type Trends:
# 
# Petrol and Diesel cars dominate the market, while Electric vehicles are still less common, reflecting current industry adoption rates.
# 
# 4.Mileage vs. Price Relationship:
# 
# Higher mileage generally results in lower prices, but some high-mileage cars retain value, likely due to brand reputation or premium models.
# 
# 5.Outlier Detection & Cleaning:
# 
# Extreme values in Price were identified and removed to ensure accurate trend analysis.
# 
# 6.Key Influencing Factors on Price:
# 
# Year, Mileage, and Engine Size show strong correlation with price, making them key determinants in car valuation.
# 
# 7.No Missing or Duplicate Data:
